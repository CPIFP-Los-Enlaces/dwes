## Qu√© es
*Dash DataTable is an interactive table component designed for viewing, editing, and exploring large datasets.
This component was written from scratch in React.js specifically for the Dash community. Its API was designed to be ergonomic and its behavior is completely customizable through its properties. DataTable is rendered with standard, semantic HTML ```<table/>``` markup, which makes it accessible, responsive, and easy to style.

For production Dash applications, DataTable is intended to be used with Python data pipelines for ingesting the table data and Design Kit for DataTable styling.*
